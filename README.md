### This is my Seattle Ops201n2 Challenge Repo README!


### This repo is the place where I have stored all my Ops 201 Challenges. It has a few different languages such as Bash, PowerShell, and Batch. 


I am learning these skills to ultimately be proficient in cybersecurity, and to do that you need a strong base knowledge of how computers talk, read, and transmit information/data. 
These basic shell scripts are the foundation of my learning journey.

In this 201 course, a few fundamental scripting concepts I learned was how to use the command line to pull network and computer information for analytic and diagnostic purposes, as well as write scripts to automate the deployment of Windows end points.

My favorite Ops Challenge was number 7. In this challenge I was tasked with using grep with the lshw command to pick out specific system info and exclude others.  
I felt comfortable enough with Bash that I added a user menu function but also added some code to change the color of the output in the terminal which was a new fun little trick.

One specific Ops challenge comes to mind when thinking of how these shells can be applied to the workplace; Ops challenge 11 "Automated Endpoint", this script had numerous helpful functions that would be deployed on endpoint Windows systems to automate the setup.  
This would be invaluable to implement in a startup company to help expedite their workstation deployment.    

If I had more time to go back and improve my scripts, I would start with Ops Challenge 13.  
I feel as though my code is a little sloppy and can be re-organized for better readability.  
There are also some earlier scripts that could be reworked with the knowledge I have gained through this course as well.

I am hoping to improve my overall comprehension and confidence with shell scripting.  
I really have enjoyed Bash and look forward to digging into python!

### Onwards and forwards!!
